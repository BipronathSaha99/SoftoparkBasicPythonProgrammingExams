# Softopark_Exam
<feat>: Softopark Exam based on Basic Python Prgramming contest files are included here. 
  
After Completing Basic Python Course which was for the beginners, Softpark authorities arranged an exam where 10 questions were uplodated for the students and I've solved the nine problems from the ten. During the solving problems I took the help from the python documentation and here I am attaching the Python documentation link on the comment section.
